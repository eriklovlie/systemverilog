{"name":"Systemverilog","tagline":"SystemVerilog stuff and stuff.","body":"### What is this?\r\n\r\nA SystemVerilog parser of course. Its distinguishing features are:\r\n\r\n* open source\r\n* convenient (sed -i 's/vcs/simshim.py/g' Makefile)\r\n* consumes unprocessed verilog and systemverilog (it will do the preprocessing)\r\n* error diagnostics are (in theory) quite good (keeps track of include chains and macro instantiations)\r\n* you can build tools on it (either in Java/Scala or by using the XML output)\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\n\r\nStandard open source disclaimer here. I've not promised it works with your testbench, nor that it won't melt your hard drive. It works for the code I have available and you can have a look at the source code and make an informed decision.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nStarted by @eriklovlie.\r\n\r\nYourkit.com contributed their awesome profiler, thanks!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
