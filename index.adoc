= SystemVerilog Stuff
:toc: left

== What is this?

A SystemVerilog parser of course. And some other stuff. You can find the source here:

https://github.com/svstuff/systemverilog

Its distinguishing features are:

* open source
* convenient (`sed -i 's/vcs/simshim.py/g' Makefile`)
* consumes unprocessed verilog and systemverilog (it will do the preprocessing)
* error diagnostics are (in theory) quite good (keeps track of include chains and macro instantiations)
* you can build tools on it (either in Java/Scala or by using the XML output)

== Disclaimer

Standard open source disclaimer. I've not promised it works with your testbench, nor that it won't melt your hard drive.
It works for the code I have available and you can have a look at the source code and make an informed decision.
